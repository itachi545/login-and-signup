## ðŸŽ‰ About <a name = "about"></a>
The login and registration system is an essential component of any web application that requires user authentication and authorization. In this mini-project, we will develop a simple yet effective login and registration system using PHP and MySQL. The system will include a registration form where users can create an account by providing their basic information such as name, email, and password. Once registered, users can log in to the application and access secure areas. The system will also include password encryption, session management, and error handling to ensure security and reliability. Overall, this mini-project will provide a solid foundation for implementing a robust login and registration system in any web application.
